# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project 
  Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

  In this scenaior I was asked to refactor code in order to increase the speed of the action. 

## Results (analysis with screenshots and code)

## Summary (advantages and disadvatanges of refactoring code in general and about the code here)

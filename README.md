# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project 
  Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

  In this scenaior I was asked to refactor code in order to increase the speed of the action.

## Summary (advantages and disadvatanges of refactoring code in general and about the code here)
  According to Ershad (2017, Jan 09), there are some advantages and disadvatanges of refactoring code. The adantages can include increasing the speed of programs, fixing bugs, and peer review. However, there are disadvatanges such as the time it takes to do it well, the ROI of the task, and the support for the task. The overall goal of refactoring is to improve the code to make it useable longer and remove smelly code that could cause future defects. Code that has been improved and simplified also has less chance of developing issues later.
